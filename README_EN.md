#### About myself

Hi, my name is Sergey.

I am currently looking for a job as a Test Automation Engineer - QA Automation Engineer.

I am working in software testing for almost 15 years.
Last 10 of them as a Senior QA Engineer.
In recent years I am developing in the direction of autotesting.

I have experience in:
- writing autotests for Windows applications using client-server architecture to run tests simultaneously on multiple testbeds (tests are written in Python using PyTest to organize tests and Allure to build reports)
- writing autotests for Web applications using the Page Object Model (in Python, using Selenium Webdriver, PyTest and Allure)
- writing autotests for Windows applications with non-standard GUI elements (tests are written in C#, using MbUnit to organize tests and Sikuli to recognize and interact with GUI elements)
- using Git to store and work with the test sources in the engineering team
- organizing testing processes in companies from scratch (preparing test procedures and test plans for projects, introducing new testing tools and systems)
- managing a team of testers (including distribution and control of tasks within projects, training of new specialists).

Communicative, independent, eager to learn and apply new technologies in my work.

I will be glad to communicate, talk about my experience and learn about your company and projects.

With respect, 
Sergey Toroshchin.
